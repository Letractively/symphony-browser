= V0.0.002 -> v0.0.003 =
*Backend Stuff:*
  * A few minor bug fixes 

*Frontend Stuff:*
  * A few minor UI improvements
  * A completely new, unique, and intuitive system that works very similar to normal browser tabs.

*Fixed Bugs:*
  * The NoScript manager icon sometimes does not show up if it goes from disabled to enabled state.
  * "Invalid Url" sometimes shows up in the status bar even when the URL connects fine.
  * The favicon doesn't load correctly sometimes.
  * The address bar is set to a different tab's URL. This happens more often when lots of tabs are open. This is being worked on.
